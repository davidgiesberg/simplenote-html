<p>simpleview is a <b>read-only</b> HTML/JavaScript client for <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">simplenote</a>, written because I wanted to be able to read my notes on my Android phone, and I couldn't be bothered to write a real Java application for it. It stores the contents of
your notes in local storage, so it's fast, and it'll poll for changes,
and once I get the manifest working it'll work offline and be
bookmarkable on your iphone home screen if you're into that sort of
thing.</p>

<p>Caveats - <b>it's experimental</b>. It's read-only - you can't change notes
yet, this represents an afternoon of work, not a real project. I don't
really care about the ability to edit notes, 80% of my use case is
just reading things I've written on the desktop.</p>

<p>Most importantly, because of HTML and cross-domain stuff being what it
is, <b>all requests made my this app go to MY server</b>, and I proxy them to
the simplenote server. This means that (a) I might be logging your
password (I'm not, but you can't prove that), and (b) it all goes over
HTTP because I don't have an HTTPS certificate, so someone else can
sniff your password.</p>

<p><b>DO NOT USE IT IF YOU CARE ABOUT THIS.</b></p>
